# XAI
# ðŸ’¡Note>
This idea needs so many computing resource. <br>
Now so, i could devise another novel idea. and develope it in private repo with visualization source code.<br>
thanks.

This repository is for research on time series using XAI, specifically Integrated Gradients [IG]. I'm working on making the Time Series Forecasting model more efficient, and I'm currently writing a paper, so I've only posted versions that are different from the one I'm working on.

They represent the following:

ðŸ’¡**FirstDevisingExperiment:**
The first experiment I devised when I thought of this idea.

ðŸ’¡**GeneralDataEvaluation:**
Experiments using the Benchmark Dataset for Time Series Forecasting, as well as specific data.

ðŸ’¡**Exogeneous_RNN_Model:**
: Experiment on Multivariate Forecasting based on RNN, not just MLP in general.

Currently, we have many more progresses, but please understand that we can't share them to write a paper.

Here is a schematic of the previous version.
